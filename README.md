# Vision Transformer implementation in TensorFlow 2.x

This repository is the unofficial implementation of the paper named 
**AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS:
TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE**. While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural
language processing tasks, this paper used the transformer architecture and achived SOTA performance in image recognition.

## Setup
The repository can be cloned using the below commands.


```
git clone https://github.com/TheTensorDude/vision_transformer_tf.git
